\chapter{BMS Hardware}
The need to measure an high amount of voltages and temperatures scattered around the battery pack means that a decentralized structure for the BMS components is preferable. The two main types of logic boards are the \textbf{Mainboard} and the \textbf{Cellboard}.

Every cellboard measures voltages and temperatures of a \textsl{section} of the pack, and sends data back to the Mainboard via CAN bus. The Mainboard inteprets the received data and takes actions based on them.

\section{Mainboard}
The mainboard is the central control unit of the BMS. It is composed of a microcontroller, two CAN-bus lines, two serial ports and one SPI connection.
